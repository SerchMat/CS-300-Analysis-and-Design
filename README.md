# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design

* What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    The problem to analyze was developing different data structures to display and sort a list of classes. Starting with vector, hashing and binary tree, each of these methods is useful, and depending on the scenario, it needs to be used correctly.
    
* How did you approach the problem?
    First, I look of what were the goal and the requirements which will be working with. Based on the analysis of the problem and the possible solution, proceed to create a flowchart to have a better idea of the design. After the problem is being analyzed and designed, I proceed to code. 
    
* How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    Problems are a normal thing once we implement new ways when we learn a concept. The instructor constantly updated us on possible problems and YouTube videos with broad information helped me to develop a better program.
    
* How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    This project helped me to increase my skill in analyzing possible solutions in more detail. Also, the use of pseudocode or flowchart before starting coding was useful and provide a better idea of how to develop the solution. 

* How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    The project helped me to analyze what and how programs would be developed with the most maintainable, readable, and adaptable capability in every scenario. Analyzing the different possible answers would lead to a better development of the program.
